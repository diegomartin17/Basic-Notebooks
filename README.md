## Notebooks

### Hyperparameter-Optimization.ipynb
We will show how to use 'GridSearchCV' and 'scikit-optimize' for hyperparameter optimization. We will use a simple dataset and a simple model (xgboost) to understand the concept of hyperparameter optimization.

### Keras-Neural-Network.ipynb
We will show how to use Keras to build a simple neural network.

### Preprocessing-functions.ipynb
In this notebook, we will implement some preprocessing functions for data cleaning, data transformation, and data scaling. We will use a simple dataset to demonstrate how the functions work. It includes the following functions:
- Min Max Normalization
- Undersampling
- Oversampling (SMOTE)
- Basic Data Split
- Temporal Data Split

### Torch-Neural-Network.ipynb
We will show how to use PyTorch to build a simple neural network.

### Images-functions.ipynb
We will implement some functions for image processing. We will use a simple dataset to demonstrate how the functions work. It can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitij192/cars-image-dataset
