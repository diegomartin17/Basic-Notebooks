## Notebooks
### Hyperparameter-Optimization.ipynb
We will show how to use 'GridSearchCV' and 'scikit-optimize' for hyperparameter optimization. We will use a simple dataset and a simple model (xgboost) to understand the concept of hyperparameter optimization.
### Keras-Neural-Network.ipynb
We will show how to use Keras to build a simple neural network. We will use a simple dataset to understand how to build a neural network using Keras.
### Preprocessing-functions.ipynb
In this notebook, we will implement some preprocessing functions for data cleaning, data transformation, and data scaling. We will use a simple dataset to demonstrate how the functions work. It includes the following functions:
- Min Max Normalization
- Undersampling
- Oversampling (SMOTE)
- Basic Data Split
- Temporal Data Split
### Torch-Neural-Network.ipynb
We will show how to use PyTorch to build a simple neural network. We will use a simple dataset to understand how to build a neural network using PyTorch.
